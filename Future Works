1. Explore Fine-tuning BERT on Netflix specific data
  - Train the BERT model primarily focused on Netflix descriptions and user-generated reviews to enhance sentiment classification accuracy.
  - Can improve the model understanding on the context, sentiment, and entertainment-related expressions to the Netflix show description
2. Use advanced ensemble learning such as weighted averaging
  - It assigns a higher weight to models that are more accurate.
  - More optimized sentiment classification can improve accuracy as it uses the best features from each model. 
3. Adapting a domain to improve sentiment detection
  - Train the model using real Netflix-specific slang and expressions and use domain adaptation techniques to adjust sentiment classifiers for streaming-related text.
  - Model will have a better understanding of modern, informal, and entertainment-specific language.
